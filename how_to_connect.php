   How to play on L2 Blackstar :

<ol>
   <li>You will need Lineage 2 - Gracia Epiloge installed.<br />
       If you still don't have you can download it from <a>here</a> and install.<br />
       (You might need to run the official updater (<i>Your_Lineage2_Folder</i>/Lineage2.exe))
   <li>Download our system folder.
   <br />
      <a>mirror1</a> <a>mirror2</a><br />
       If you don't want to lose any of your screenshots/data, rename your current system folder (eg. to "system1") and place our's in its place.
</ol>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Lineage2 Client is now ready, but you'll need to open an account.
